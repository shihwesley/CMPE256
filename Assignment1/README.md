For the Time series Prediction using VAR Model, I ran the whole notebook. I have a screenshot of the end of the notebook.

UPDATE:
I was able to figure out the prophet module installation issue. According to its own website, they only do python 3.7 above and only call 'pip install prophet' not 'pip install fbprophet'. Now, prophet is isntalled and the cell can call Prophet() function.
